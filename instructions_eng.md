This app lets you select map locations of known floodplain habitat types in the Amazon. This data will be invaluable for us to improve current maps of the distribution of these habitats along the entire Amazon river and main tributaries.


To start finding habitats, just go to the **Mapping** window, select a habitat type, and use the provided Google Satellite background to help you. *We assume you have field knowledge regarding the location of the habitat types below, and that the background image is just a helper to guide you*. 

We are currenly interested in the following habitats:

- *Varzea Forest*: closed forests growing on 'white water'(eutrophic) river floodplains.

- *Igapo Forest*: closed forests growing on 'black'and 'clear' water (oligotrophic) river floodplains.

- *Woodlands*: open canopy areas such as early sucession 'Embauba' (Cecropia spp.) and 'Munguba'(Pseudobombax munguba) stands, palm swamps, and low density "chavascal" areas.

- *Shrubs*: dense, short shrublike vegetation, including Montrichardia stands.

- *Herbaceous/Mud*: areas where herbaceous plants develop during some point of the year. That includes floating macrophytes, flooded grasslands, and lake bottom areas that usually become vegetated during the dry season.

- *Urban*: urban settlements.

- *Sand Bank*: sand banks that become exposed during the low water season.

- *Bare Rocks*: areas of exposed rock surfaces, such as rapids.

- *White Water*: eutrophic streams, rivers and lakes with high sediment load. Example: Amazon River

- *Black Water*: oligotrophic streams, rivers and lakes with low sediment and high organic matter load. Example: Negro River

- *Clear Water*: oligotrophic streams, rivers and lakes with low sediment and low organic matter load. Example: Tapaj√≥s River.
